shall be referred to the competent authority forthwith No public authority is permitted to inquire into a person39s identity on account of a request to examine an official document or inquire into the

over it the applicant may appeal against the decision An appeal against a decision by a minister shall be lodged with the Government and an appeal against a decision by another authority shall be

identity to be produced on examination of witnesses or of a party in the proceedings under oath In examination under paragraph two point 4 or 5 the court shall scrupulously ensure that no questions are put which might encroach upon a duty of confidentiality in excess of what is permissible in each particular case Art 4 No public authority or other public body may inquire into the identity of the author of material inserted or intended for insertion in printed matter a person who has published or who intends to publish material in such matter or a person who has communicated information under

been declared to be criminal or if the circumstances are otherwise exceptionally aggravating the penalty is imprisonment for up to one year Art 13 The penalties specified in Article 12 apply also to a person who knowingly submits false information in an application or notification under this Chapter or a declaration appended to such an application or notification Art 14 If the owner of a periodical fails to report a new place of publication or a new publishing schedule under Article 8 the penalty is a monetary fine If a responsible editor breaches the provisions of Article 11 the penalty is a

point 14 or 15 and the printed matter is a periodical an order may be issued on request for the verdict to be inserted in the periodical Art 7 Printed matter containing an offence against the freedom of the press may be confiscated Confiscation of printed matter means the destruction of all copies intended for dissemination and the taking of such action with respect to forms lithographic stones stereotypes plates and other such material adapted exclusively to the printing of the matter as will render impossible their misuse Art 8 In conjunction with the confiscation of a periodical publication of the periodical may be prohibited in the case of an offence referred to in Article 4 points 1 to 3 point 4 insofar as the offence is to be regarded as gross and points 6 and 7 for a particular period to be determined by the court but not exceeding six months from the date on which the court39s ruling in the freedom of the press case acquired legal force Such a ban may however be issued only when the country is at war General provisions of law applying to forfeiture of objects on account of an offence apply to the confiscation of a periodical disseminated in violation of a ban on publication or manifestly constituting a continuation of a periodical specified in such a ban Chapter 8 Liability rules Part 1 On liability for periodicals Art 1 Liability under penal law for an offence against the freedom of the press committed by means of a periodical lies with the person notified as responsible editor at the time when the periodical was published If a deputy had been notified and was acting as responsible editor the deputy is liable Art 2 If no certificate of no legal impediment to publication existed at the time when the periodical was published or if the responsible editor liable under Article 1 paragraph one was no longer qualified or his or her appointment as responsible editor had otherwise been terminated the owner is liable The owner is likewise liable in a case in which the responsible editor was appointed for appearance39s sake or was otherwise manifestly not in possession of the powers stipulated in Chapter 5 Article 3 at the time when the periodical was published If a deputy acting as responsible editor was no longer qualified at the time when the periodical was published or if his or her appointment had otherwise been terminated or if a circumstance specified in paragraph two applied in respect of the deputy the responsible editor is liable Art 3 If it is impossible to establish the identity of the owner at the time when the periodical was published the printer is liable in place of the owner Art 4 If a person disseminates a periodical which lacks information concerning the name of the printer or if such information is known to the disseminator to be incorrect and the identity of the printer cannot be ascertained the disseminator is liable in place of the printer Part 2 On liability for nonperiodical printed matter Art 5 Liability under penal law for an offence against the freedom of the press committed by means of nonperiodical printed matter lies with the author if he or she has been identified as the author of the printed matter in the manner prescribed in Chapter 3 Article 2 The author is not however liable if the matter was published without his or her consent or if his or her name pseudonym or penname appeared therein against his or her will Art 6 If an author is not liable under Article 5 for matter which includes or is intended to include contributions from several authors and if a particular editor has been identified in the manner prescribed in Chapter 3 Article 2 the editor is liable In the case of printed matter other than printed matter under paragraph one the editor is liable only if the author was deceased when the matter was published The editor is not liable if his or her name pseudonym or penname appeared on the matter against his or her will The editor of nonperiodical printed matter is understood to be the person who without being the author delivers the matter for printing and publication Art 7 If neither the author nor the editor is liable under Article 5 or 6 or if when the matter was published he or she was deceased the publisher is liable The publisher of nonperiodical printed matter is understood to be the person who has undertaken to print and publish the writings of another Art 8 If there was no publisher or if the identity of the publisher cannot be ascertained the printer is liable in place of the publisher Art 9 The provisions of Article 4 apply in a similar manner to the liability of a disseminator of nonperiodical printed matter Part 3 Provisions applying to all printed matter Art 10 If the person who would have been liable under Article 2 5 6 or 7 at the time of publication of the printed matter has no known place of domicile within the Realm and if his or her current whereabouts within the Realm cannot be ascertained in the case liability shall pass to the person liable next thereafter but not to the editor of nonperiodical printed matter other than in a case under Article 6 paragraph one or to a disseminator The same applies if a circumstance pertained in respect of the person liable under Article 1 2 5 6 or 7 which according to law excluded criminal responsibility and if the person liable next thereafter was aware of or should have been aware of the circumstance Art 11 A circumstance which would result in the liability under this Chapter of a person other than the defendant shall be taken into consideration only if the circumstance was adduced prior to the main hearing Art 12 In determining the liability of a person responsible for printed matter under this Chapter the content of the matter shall be deemed to have been inserted with the knowledge and consent of the person concerned Chapter 9 On supervision and prosecution Art 1 The Chancellor of Justice shall monitor that the limits set in this Act for the freedom of the press are not transgressed Art 2 The Chancellor of Justice is sole prosecutor in cases concerning offences against the freedom of the press No one other than the Chancellor of Justice may institute a preliminary investigation concerning offences against the freedom of the press Only the Chancellor of Justice and a court of law may approve coercive measures on suspicion that such an offence has been committed unless otherwise provided in this Act The Government has the right to report printed matter to the Chancellor of Justice for prosecution on account of an offence against the freedom of the press It may be laid down in an act of law that legal proceedings on account of an offence against the freedom of the press may be instituted only with the Government39s consent The Chancellor of Justice is likewise sole prosecutor in freedom of the press cases which are not cases concerning offences against the freedom of the press and in cases otherwise relating to violations of regulations contained in this Act provisions of law however regulate the right of the Parliamentary Ombudsman to act as prosecutor in cases of this nature Art 3 Legal proceedings on account of an offence against the freedom of the press shall be instituted in the case of a periodical for which a valid certificate of no legal impediment to publication existed at the time of publication within six months and in the case of other printed matter within one year from the date of publication with effect that the matter shall otherwise be exempt from such proceedings This provision notwithstanding if such proceedings have been instituted within the time specified fresh proceedings may nevertheless be instituted against another person who is liable in respect of the offence Provisions of law governing the period within which an offence must be prosecuted if penal sanctions are not to lapse apply also with respect to offences against the freedom of the press Art 4 Provisions of law govern the right of a private plaintiff to report an offence against the freedom of the press or bring charges on account of such an offence Art 5 If no one is liable under Chapter 8 for the offence or if no summons can be served within the Realm on the person liable the prosecutor or the plaintiff may apply to have the printed matter confiscated instead of instituting legal proceedings Chapter 10 On special coercive measures Art 1 If there are grounds for the possible confiscation of printed matter on account of an offence against the freedom of the press the printed matter may be impounded pending a decision In a case under Chapter 7 Article 8 an order may also be issued prohibiting publication of a periodical pending a decision by the court Art 2 If the offence falls within the scope of public prosecution the Chancellor of Justice may order the printed matter to be impounded and publication prohibited under Article 1 before proceedings have been instituted on account of an offence against the freedom of the press or application made to the court for confiscation of the printed matter It may be laid down in law that a public prosecutor may be similarly empowered to order material to be impounded within his or her jurisdiction Art 3 If impoundment has been effected without a court order the person affected may demand to have the matter examined before a court of law When a public prosecutor has ordered material to be impounded the Chancellor of Justice shall be notified promptly The Chancellor of Justice shall determine forthwith whether the order shall be upheld Art 4 When the Chancellor of Justice has ordered material to be impounded or has confirmed an order issued by a public prosecutor legal proceedings shall be instituted or application made for confiscation of the printed matter within two weeks from the date on which the Chancellor of Justice pronounced his or her decision Failing such action the impoundment order and any accompanying order prohibiting publication lapse Art 5 Once legal proceedings have been instituted for an offence against the freedom of the press or an application has been made to the court for printed matter to be confiscated the court is entitled to order the matter to be impounded and publication prohibited or to rescind an impoundment order or order prohibiting publication which has already been issued In reaching its decision in such a case the court shall determine whether an order which has been issued shall continue in force If the case is dismissed because the court is not competent or if the court otherwise dismisses the case without determining whether the printed matter is of a criminal nature and if there is reason to suppose that there will be an application for confiscation in another case the court may confirm the order for a particular period which the court determines If no proceedings are instituted within this period the order lapses Art 6 An impoundment order shall contain a statement indicating the passage or passages in the printed matter which occasioned the order and applies only to the volume part issue or instalment in which these passages occur Art 7 An impoundment order shall be executed by the police authority forthwith Provisions of law concerning the prohibition of the dissemination of printed matter which is subject to an impoundment order are laid down in Chapter 6 Article 3 Art 8 Impoundment of printed matter shall relate only to copies intended for dissemination Proof of impoundment of printed matter shall be provided as soon as possible and free of charge both to the person against whom impoundment was effected and to the person who printed the material Such proof shall indicate the passage or passages in the printed matter which occasioned the impoundment order Art 9 When an impoundment order has been rescinded or has lapsed execution of impoundment is reversed forthwith Art 10 Repealed Art 11 If the Realm is at war or exposed to the danger of war and printed matter is discovered at a unit of the armed forces which manifestly constitutes such criminal sedition under Chapter 7 Article 4 as may induce members of the armed forces to neglect their duties the printed matter may be taken into safekeeping pending issue of an impoundment order on a decision by the officer competent in law to decide matters of disciplinary responsibility in respect of the unit concerned If delay may prove detrimental action under paragraph one may also be taken by another officer under provisions laid down in law in the absence of a decision under paragraph one Such action shall however be reported promptly to the officer referred to in paragraph one This officer shall consider forthwith whether the printed matter shall remain in safekeeping Art 12 When a decision has been made to take printed matter into safekeeping under the provisions of Article 11 the Chancellor of Justice shall be notified as soon as possible The Chancellor of Justice then considers forthwith whether the printed matter shall be impounded Art 13 General provisions of law applying to the impoundment of objects which may be declared forfeit apply to the impoundment of a periodical disseminated in violation of an order prohibiting publication or manifestly constituting a continuation of a periodical the publication of which has thus been prohibited Art 14 A copy of printed matter which can reasonably be presumed to have significance for the investigation of a freedom of the press case may be impounded The provisions of Articles 2 and 3 5 paragraph one 6 7 paragraph one and 9 apply General provisions of law relating to impoundment apply in relevant parts Legal proceedings shall however always be instituted within one month from the date on which the impoundment order was issued if the court does not allow an extension in response to a submission from the Chancellor of Justice Chapter 11 On private claims for damages Art 1 A private claim for damages based on an abuse of the freedom of the press may be pursued only on grounds that the printed matter to which the claim relates contains an offence against the freedom of the press Unless otherwise provided below such a claim may be pursued only against the person liable under penal law for the offence under Chapter 8 If by reason of circumstances under Chapter 8 Article 10 liability has passed to such a person the claim may also be pursued against the person liable forthwith before him or her provided that and to the extent that grounds exist in law for the pursuit of such a claim The provisions of Chapter 8 Article 12 concerning liability under penal law apply also with regard to private claims for damages Relevant provisions of law apply with regard to private claims for damages in respect of offences under Chapter 7 Article 2 or 3 Art 2 A private claim for damages which may be pursued against the responsible editor of a periodical or his or her deputy may be pursued also against the owner In the case of other printed matter a claim which may be pursued against the author or editor may be pursued also against the publisher Art 3 If a person is liable for damages on account of an offence against the freedom of the press as legal representative of a legal person or as a guardian trustee or administrator the claim for damages may also be pursued against the legal person or the person for whom the guardian trustee or administrator was appointed provided that and to the extent that grounds exist in law for the pursuit of such a claim Art 4 If a person is liable together with another person for damages under this Chapter such persons are liable jointly and separately The apportionment of liability between the parties is determined in accordance with relevant provisions of law Art 5 A private claim for damages may be pursued on account of an offence against the freedom of the press even if liability under penal law has lapsed or an action under penal law is otherwise excluded Chapter 12 On court proceedings in freedom of the press cases Art 1 Freedom of the press cases are heard by the district court within whose jurisdiction the county administration has its seat Should any reason prompt the designation of another district court within the county administrative district to hear freedom of the press cases the Government may adopt an ordinance to this effect Freedom of the press cases are cases concerning liability under penal law or private claims for damages on account of offences against the freedom of the press and application cases under Chapter 9 Article 5 Freedom of the press cases also include cases concerning liability under penal law and private claims for damages in relation to offences under Chapter 7 Article 3 If the case concerns an offence under paragraph two of the lastnamed Article and if the person who procured the information or intelligence has not published it in printed matter or communicated it to some other person for the purpose of such publication the case shall however be tried as a freedom of the press case only provided it is manifest that the information was procured for the purpose of publication in printed matter Art 2 In freedom of the press cases in which there is a question of liability under penal law the question of whether an offence has been committed shall be tried by a jury of nine members unless both parties have declared themselves willing to refer the case for decision by the court without trial by jury The question of whether the defendant is liable for the printed matter under Chapter 8 is however always tried by the court sitting alone When the question of whether an offence has been committed is tried by a jury the answer shall be deemed to be in the affirmative if at least six members of the jury concur in that opinion If the jury finds that no offence has been committed the defendant shall be acquitted If the jury finds that an offence has been committed the question shall also be examined by the court If the opinion of the court differs from that of the jury the court is entitled to acquit the defendant or apply a penal provision carrying a milder sanction than that applied by the jury A superior court to which the judgment of a district court has been referred on appeal is no more entitled than the district court to overturn the jury39s verdict Art 3 Jurors shall be appointed for each county administrative district and are divided into two groups with 16 jurors in the first group and 8 in the second In the case of the Stockholm county administrative district the first group shall however consist of 24 jurors and the second of 12 The jurors in the second group shall hold currently or shall have held previously appointments as lay assessors of a court of general jurisdiction or a public administrative court Art 4 Jurors are appointed by election for a period of four calendar years Jurors shall be elected by the county council of the county administrative district or where the county administrative district includes a municipality which does not come under the county council by the county council and the council of the municipality concerned Jurors in the Gotland county administrative district are elected by the Gotland municipal council If under the foregoing jurors are to be elected by more than one electoral body the county administrative board shall apportion the number of jurors in each group among the electoral bodies in proportion to population When a juror is to be elected the district court shall notify the authority responsible for arranging the election to this effect Art 5 Jurors shall be appointed from among Swedish citizens domiciled in the county administrative district for which they are to be appointed They should be known for their soundness of judgment independence and fairmindedness Different social groups and currents of opinion and different parts of the county administrative district should be represented among the jurors No person who is a minor or for whom an administrator has been appointed under special provisions of law may be a juror Art 6 A juror who has attained the age of sixty has the right to resign his or her appointment If in any other circumstances a juror wishes to retire the district court considers whether valid cause exists to prevent him or her from carrying out his or her duties If a juror ceases to be eligible for election the appointment lapses Art 7 If a juror retires or ceases to be eligible for election the electoral body shall appoint another person from among the group of jurors to which he or she belonged to replace him or her for the remainder of the electoral period Such a juror may be elected by the county council executive committee in place of the county council such an election is however valid only until the county council next meets Art 8 Appeals concerning the election of a juror shall be lodged with the district court The court examines the qualifications of those elected even if no appeal is lodged Provisions of law relating to appeals against decisions of an inferior court apply to appeals against decisions of a district court on a matter under paragraph one There is no right of appeal against the decision of the court of appeal If an appeal is lodged the election nevertheless remains valid unless the court rules otherwise Art 9 The names of persons appointed to serve as jurors shall be entered on a list of jurors Each group shall be entered separately on this list Art 10 In a case which is to be tried by a jury the court shall present the list of jurors and consider whether there are grounds for disqualifying any person on the list Provisions of law relating to the disqualification of judges apply to the disqualification of jurors The jury is empanelled thereafter from among the undisqualified jurors in such a way that each party is permitted to exclude three jurors in the first group and one in the second and the court then selects by lot a sufficient number of deputies from among the remaining jurors to leave six in the first group and three in the second In the case of a jury in the Stockholm county administrative district each party is permitted to exclude five jurors in the first group and two in the second Art 11 If there are several parties on one side only one of whom wishes to exercise his or her right to exclude jurors an exclusion made by that party is deemed to be an exclusion made also by the other parties If coparties wish to exclude different jurors and are unable to reach agreement the court makes the exclusion by lot Art 12 No person may avoid jury service without legal cause If the number of members required in a group cannot be made up because of disqualification or legal excuse the court nominates three qualified group members for each juror required Each party is permitted to exclude one of the persons so nominated No one may be nominated as a juror who has already been excluded in the same proceedings Art 13 If several cases in which a jury is to act are being heard concurrently the court may rule after conferring with the parties that the same jury shall act in all the cases If a jury is to be empanelled jointly for two or more cases the provisions of Article 11 concerning the exclusion of jurors in a case in which there is more than one party on one side apply in a similar manner Art 14 If in proceedings concerning liability under penal law an action for damages is brought against a person other than the defendant the measures which fall under Article 2 paragraph one Article 10 paragraph two and Article 12 paragraph two to be taken by a respondent fall to the defendant If an action is brought which is not connected with criminal proceedings but concerns confiscation of printed matter or a private claim for damages the provisions of Articles 2 and 10 to 13 apply concerning court proceedings in the case if however the question of whether an offence has been committed has already been examined in a freedom of the press case concerning liability under penal law the same question shall not be reexamined In an application case the exclusion of jurors which otherwise falls to the parties in the case is made by the court by lot Art 15 More detailed provisions regarding court proceedings in freedom of the press cases are laid down in law Where there are several district courts in one county administrative district which are competent to hear freedom of the press cases the duties specified in Articles 4 6 8 and 9 shall be carried out by the district court designated by the Government Art 16 For cases in which the country is at war or exposed to the danger of war or such exceptional conditions prevail as result from the war or danger of war to which the country has been exposed provisions may be laid down in an act of law or in an ordinance adopted by the Government with authority in law concerning the postponement of elections of jurors or exceptions to the right of a juror to resign his or her appointment Chapter 13 On matter printed abroad etc Art 1 The provisions of Chapters 1 3 6 and 7 Chapter 8 Articles 1 2 5 to 7 and 10 to 12 and Chapters 9 to 12 apply in relevant parts to matter printed abroad and published in the Realm unless otherwise provided below Art 2 Matter printed abroad shall be deemed to have been published within the Realm if it has been delivered for dissemination within the Realm as described in Chapter 1 Article 6 Art 3 If a periodical which is printed abroad is intended primarily for dissemination within the Realm the provisions of Chapter 5 apply in relevant parts the provisions relating to the qualifications of owners shall not apply Publication in the Realm of any other periodical printed abroad does not require a certificate of no legal impediment to publication Should such a certificate exist the provisions of paragraph one shall apply in respect of the periodical Art 4 The provisions of this Act concerning the liability under penal law of a person who has produced printed matter shall refer in respect of matter printed abroad to the person who caused the matter to be delivered for dissemination within the Realm or if it is impossible to establish his or her identity or if at the time of publication he or she was not domiciled within the Realm to the person who is deemed to be the disseminator under Chapter 6 Art 5 Provisions are laid down in law concerning the obligation to retain for scrutiny copies of matter printed abroad and to furnish copies of such matter to libraries or archives Art 6 In the case of matter which is printed abroad and published in the Realm but not intended primarily for dissemination within the Realm and for which no certificate of no legal impediment to publication exists the provisions of Chapter 1 Article 1 paragraphs three and four concerning the communication and procurement of information and intelligence for publication apply unless 1 communication or procurement constitutes an offence against the security of the Realm 2 communication includes supply or release of documents under Chapter 7 Article 3 paragraph one point 2 or 3 communication constitutes deliberate disregard of a duty of confidentiality Paragraph one applies also in respect of matter not published in Sweden regardless of whether it is printed here or abroad In this connection a person who contributes to material in a periodical by other means as author or other originator is equated with a person communicating information for publication If communication or procurement is punishable under law pursuant to
