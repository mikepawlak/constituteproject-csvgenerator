pending before the High Court are exceptional the High Court may order that the proceeding be transferred to the Court of Appeal 2 Without limiting the generality of subsection 1 the circumstances of a proceeding may be exceptional if— a a party to the proceeding intends to submit that a relevant decision of the Court of Appeal should be overruled by the Court of Appeal b the proceeding raises 1 or more issues of considerable public importance that need to be determined urgently and those issues are unlikely to be determined urgently if the proceeding is heard and determined by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal c the proceeding does not raise any question of fact or any significant question of fact but does raise 1 or more questions of law that are the subject of conflicting decisions of the High Court 3 In deciding whether to transfer a proceeding under subsection 1 a Judge must have regard to the following matters a the primary purpose of the Court of Appeal as an appellate court b the desirability of obtaining a determination at first instance and a review of that determination on appeal c whether a full court of the High Court could effectively determine the question in issue d whether the proceeding raises any question of fact or any significant question of fact e whether the parties have agreed to the transfer of the proceeding to the Court of Appeal f any other matter that the Judge considers that he or she should have regard to in the public interest 4 The fact that the parties to a proceeding agree to the transfer of the proceeding to the Court

effect from the date of the meeting unless another time is specified for the performance of the function or duty or for the exercise of the power to take effect 3 Neither the validity of the

from attending the meeting of the Executive Council by some necessary or reasonable cause 3B Exercise of powers and duties by Administrator 1 The Administrator of the Government may perform a function or duty imposed on the GovernorGeneral or exercise a power conferred on the GovernorGeneral if a the office of GovernorGeneral is vacant or b the GovernorGeneral is unable to perform the function or

behalf of the Sovereign by a Regent the royal functions of the Sovereign in right of New Zealand shall be performed in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign by that Regent 2 Nothing in subsection 1

exercise or perform personally any function duty or power 3 The fact that any person holding office as a Parliamentary UnderSecretary in respect of any Ministerial office purports to exercise or

appoint a barrister or solicitor of at least 7 years’ practice to act— a in place of or for the SolicitorGeneral during the absence from office of the SolicitorGeneral or if the SolicitorGeneral is

remedy in any proceedings of that kind if the making of that award or the granting of that remedy would because of the monetary limits contained in sections 29 to 34 of the District Courts Act 1947 be beyond the jurisdiction of a District Court 3 For the purposes of subsection 2 if civil proceedings under section 92B are brought on behalf of more than 1 complainant or as the case may be more than 1 aggrieved person those proceedings must for the purpose of applying any monetary limit under subsection 2 be treated as if each complainant or as the case may be each aggrieved person on whose behalf

remedies to High Court The Human Rights Review Tribunal must refer the granting of a remedy in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E to the High Court if the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a defendant in the proceedings has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint but that— a the granting of the appropriate remedy under section 92I would be outside the limits imposed by section 92Q or b that the granting of a remedy in those proceedings would be better dealt with by the High Court 92S Further provisions on reference to High Court 1 A reference under section 92R is made by sending to the Registrar of the High Court nearest to where the proceedings were commenced a report on the proceedings that— a sets out the Tribunal’s finding with regard to the breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint and b includes or is accompanied by a statement of the considerations to which the Tribunal has had regard in making the reference to that court 2 A copy of the report must be given or sent promptly to every party to the proceedings 3 Except as provided in this Act the procedure for

complaint 4 However no person referred to in subsection 3 may on the reference under section 92R challenge the finding of the Tribunal referred to in subsection 3 5 The High Court must decide on the

granted 92U High Court’s decision on remedies to be included in and given effect to as part of Tribunal’s determination 1 Every decision of the High Court under section 92T5— a must be remitted to the

with subsection 1a Subpart 5 Abandonment or agreement to bring claim within Tribunal’s jurisdiction 92V Abandonment to enable Tribunal to make award of damages 1 This section applies where the Tribunal would have jurisdiction in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E to make an award of damages in accordance with section 92M if the amount of the award were within the limit for the time being fixed by section 291 of the District Courts Act 1947 as applied by section 92Q2 2 The Tribunal may make an award within that limit if the plaintiff abandons the excess 3 An award of damages in those proceedings in accordance with section 92M operates to discharge from liability in respect of the amount abandoned in that way any person against whom the proceedings are brought and the subsequent award is made 4 This section overrides sections 92Q to 92U 92W Extension of jurisdiction by agreement between parties 1 If in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E only section 92Q prevents the Tribunal from granting any 1 or more of the remedies stated in section 92I and the parties to the proceedings by memorandum signed by them or their respective solicitors or agents agree that the Tribunal is to have jurisdiction to grant any 1 or more of those remedies irrespective of section 92Q the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant 1 or more of those remedies accordingly 2
